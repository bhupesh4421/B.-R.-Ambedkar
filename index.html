                <p><b> Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) </b> was an Indian jurist, economist,
                    social
                    reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the
                    Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal
                    Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

                    After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at
                    Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923,
                    respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in
                    the 1920s.[3] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an
                    economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became
                    involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political
                    rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India.
                    In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.[4]

                    In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar.
                    The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by
                    the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".</p>
